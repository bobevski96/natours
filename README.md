# natours
demo
Tourist app, node.js with express, small app, the idea is to display and creater tours, and users, with mongoDB, were you can register as a user , see and book a tour , creat a tour,
The goal is to use curd operations, authentication and authorization with tokens for users , write and read from a base. Note, this app will not have a client side, the front-end is done in just a few files with the API , just for demonstration purpose, and the .env file will be here so you can get the data, but the NODE_MODULE file is not on the repo
Olny CRUD operations are done for now,
